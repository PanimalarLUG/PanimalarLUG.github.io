* Learn how to Learn
- Stalk projects of your interest on [[github.com][github]].
- Follow relevant tags in [[http://stackoverflow.com/][StackOverflow]] and try involving in
  discussions.
- Follow discussions on [[https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/messages][slack]].
- Follow relevant [[https://www.reddit.com/][sub-reddits]] like r/programming, r/technology,
  r/darknetplan, etc
- Follow relevant people / topics in [[https://www.quora.com/][Quora]].
- Follow relevant people / hashtags in [[https://twitter.com/][Twitter]] and tweet with relevant
  tags when you learn something.
- Have a fb account not to post every fucking moment of your life but
  to join groups filled with intellectuals / progressive minds and to
  follow actually useful pages. Un-follow everyone in your
  friend-list. Mute your chat for everyone.
- *Use of any of above closed systems are highly objected by Free
  Software Philosophy but at times you may need it til you feel like
  you can stand by yourself*.
- [[https://pages.github.com/][Create a blog]] and write down whatever you learn on daily/weekly
  basis.
- Have the right people around you creating your own virtual
  space. You may not understand what it is but always be curious on
  what everyone around you talk about.
- Be nice to people!! Don't ask questions when you have documentation
  / manual. Others time is as valuable as your laziness.
- Being driven by "Being technical is cool" just don't work! One
  should rather be driven by Philosophy and Technology.
